### Current Projects and Learning

I'm current working on building my own Dungeons and Dragons character sheet view, _when_ I'm not busy with school projects that is.

To do that, I'm learning how to use the Shiny framework to build R webapps.

I love working on probability simulations and data visualizations: feel free to reach out if you're looking for collaborators on something like that!
